# Setup instructions

You will find below the instructions to set up you computer for [Le Wagon Web Development course](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course/full-time).

Please **read them carefully and execute all commands in the following order**.

If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask a teacher for help :raising_hand:

You can also have a look at [our cheatsheets](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/tree/master/docs) for common issue fixes and tips :heavy_check_mark:

Let's start :rocket:


## Zoom

To be able to interact when we are not in the same physical room, we will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), a video conferencing tool.

:warning: If you already have Zoom installed, please make sure that the version is at least **5.6**.

Go to [zoom.us/download](https://zoom.us/download).

Under **Zoom Client** click the **Download** button.

Open the file you have just downloaded to install the app.

Open the Zoom app.

If you have a Mac with Apple silicon, [you are asked to install Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861). Click Install, then enter your user name and password to allow installation to proceed.

![Install Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/macos/Big-Sur/macos-big-sur-software-update-rosetta-alert.jpg)

If you already have a Zoom account, sign in using your credentials.

If not, click on the **Sign Up Free** link:

![Sign Up Free to Zoom](images/zoom_sign_up_free.png)

You will be redirected to Zoom's website to complete a form.

When it's done, go back to the Zoom app and sign in using your credentials.

You should then see a screen like this:

![Zoom Home Screen](images/zoom_home_screen.png)

You can now close the Zoom app.


## GitHub account

Have you signed up to GitHub? If not, [do it right away](https://github.com/join).

:point_right: **[Upload a picture](https://github.com/settings/profile)** and put your name correctly on your GitHub account. This is important as we'll use an internal dashboard with your avatar. Please do this **now**, before you continue with this guide.

![GitHub picture](images/github_picture.png)


## A note about quitting apps on a Mac

Clicking the little red cross in the top left corner of the application window on a Mac **does not really quit it**, it just closes an active window. To quit the application _for real_ either press `Cmd + Q` when the application is active, or navigate to `APP_NAME` -> `Quit` in the menu bar.

![Quit Terminal on macOS](images/macos_quit.png)

During this setup you will be asked to **quit and re-open** applications multiple times, please make sure you do it properly :pray:

## Command Line Tools

Open a new terminal, copy-paste the following command and hit `Enter`:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

If you receive the following message, you can just skip this step and go to next step.

```bash
# command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates
```

Otherwise, it will open a window asking you if you want to install some software: click on "Install" and wait.


![Install xcode-select on macOS](images/macos_xcode_select_install.png)

:heavy_check_mark: If you see the message "The software was installed" then all good :+1:

:x: If the command `xcode-select --install` fails try again: sometimes the Apple servers are overloaded.

:x: If you see the message "Xcode is not currently available from the Software Update server", you need to update the software update catalog:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog
```

Once this is done, you can try to install again.


## Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is a package manager: it's a software used to install other software from the command line. Let's install it!

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This will ask for your confirmation (hit `Enter`) and your **macOS user account password** (the one you use to [log in](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202860) when you reboot your Macbook).

:warning: When you type your password, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your password as a whole but also its length. Just type your password and when you're done, press `Enter`.

If you already have Homebrew, it will tell you so, that's fine, go on.

Then install some useful software:

```bash
brew update
```

If you get a `/usr/local must be writable` error, just run this:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local
brew update
```

Error message or not, proceed running the following in the terminal (you can copy / paste all the lines at once).

```bash
brew upgrade git || brew install git
brew upgrade gh || brew install gh
brew upgrade wget || brew install wget
brew upgrade imagemagick || brew install imagemagick
brew upgrade jq || brew install jq
brew upgrade openssl || brew install openssl
```


## Visual Studio Code

### Installation

Let's install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) text editor.

Copy (`Cmd` + `C`) the command below then paste it in your terminal (`Cmd` + `V`):

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

Then launch VS Code by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
code
```

:heavy_check_mark: If a VS Code window has just opened, you're good to go :+1:

:x: Otherwise, please **contact a teacher**


## VS Code Extensions

### Installation

Let's install some useful extensions to VS Code.

Copy-paste the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
code --install-extension ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings
code --install-extension emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons
code --install-extension github.github-vscode-theme
code --install-extension MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare
code --install-extension rebornix.ruby
code --install-extension dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
code --install-extension Rubymaniac.vscode-paste-and-indent
code --install-extension alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite
```

Here is a list of the extensions you are installing:
- [Sublime Text Keymap and Settings Importer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings)
- [VSCode Great Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons)
- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
- [Ruby](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Paste and Indent](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Rubymaniac.vscode-paste-and-indent)
- [SQLite](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite)


### Live Share configuration

[Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) is a VS Code extension which allows you to share the code in your text editor for debugging and pair-programming: let's set it up!

Launch VS Code from your terminal by typing `code` and pressing `Enter`.

Click on the little arrow at the bottom of the left bar :point_down:

![VS Code Live Share](images/vscode_live_share.png)

- Click on the "Share" button, then on "GitHub (Sign in using GitHub account)".
- A popup appears asking you to sign in with GitHub: click on "Allow".
- You are redirected to a GitHub page in you browser asking you to authorize Visual Studio Code: click on "Continue" then "Authorize github".
- VS Code may display additional pop-ups: close them by clicking "OK".

That's it, you're good to go!


## macOS Terminal Theme

Launch a terminal, click on `Terminal > Preferences` and set the "Pro" theme as default profile.

![Set Pro Theme for macOS terminal](images/macos_terminal_pro.png)

In Window tab, set also your **Window Size** to Columns: 200, Rows: 50

**Quit and restart** your terminal: it should now have a nice black background, easier on the eyes.


## Oh-my-zsh

Let's install the `zsh` plugin [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

In a terminal execute the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

If asked "Do you want to change your default shell to zsh?", press `Y`

At the end your terminal should look like this:

![Ubuntu terminal with OhMyZsh](images/oh_my_zsh.png)

:heavy_check_mark: If it does, you can continue :+1:

:x: Otherwise, please **ask for a teacher**


## GitHub CLI

CLI is the acronym of [Command-line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

In this section, we will use [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to interact with GitHub directly from the terminal.

It should already be installed on your computer from the previous commands.

First in order to **login**, copy-paste the following command in your terminal:

:warning: **DO NOT edit the `email`**

```bash
gh auth login -s 'user:email' -w
```

gh will ask you few questions:

`What is your preferred protocol for Git operations?` With the arrows, choose `SSH` and press `Enter`. SSH is a protocol to log in using SSH keys instead of the well known username/password pair.

`Generate a new SSH key to add to your GitHub account?` Press `Enter` to ask gh to generate the SSH keys for you.

If you already have SSH keys, you will see instead `Upload your SSH public key to your GitHub account?` With the arrows, select your public key file path and press `Enter`.

`Enter a passphrase for your new SSH key (Optional)`. Type something you want and that you'll remember. It's a password to protect your private key stored on your hard drive. Then press `Enter`.

:warning: When you type your passphrase, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your passphrase as a whole but also its length. Just type your passphrase and when you're done, press `Enter`.

You will then get the following output:

```bash
! First copy your one-time code: 0EF9-D015
- Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
```

Select and copy the code (`0EF9-D015` in the example), then press `Enter`.

Your browser will open and ask you to authorize GitHub CLI to use your GitHub account. Accept and wait a bit.

Come back to the terminal, press `Enter` again, and that's it.

To check that you are properly connected, type:

```bash
gh auth status
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you get `Logged in to github.com as <YOUR USERNAME> `, then all good :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.


## Dotfiles (Standard configuration)

Hackers love to refine and polish their shell and tools.

We'll start with a great default configuration provided by Le Wagon: [`lewagon/dotfiles`](https://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles).

As your configuration is personal, you need your **own** repository storing it. So you will **fork** Le Wagon repository.

Forking means that you will create a new repo in your own GitHub account `$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles`, identical to the original Le Wagon one that you will be able to modify at will.

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=`gh api user | jq -r '.login'`
echo $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

:heavy_check_mark: You should see your GitHub username printed.

:x: If not, **stop here** and ask for help. There may be a problem with the previous step (`gh auth`).

Time to fork the repo and clone it on your computer:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME && cd $_
gh repo fork lewagon/dotfiles --clone
```

### Dotfiles installer

Run the `dotfiles` installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles
zsh install.sh
```

Check the emails registered with your GitHub Account. You'll need to pick one at the next step:

```bash
gh api user/emails | jq -r '.[].email'
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see the list of your registered emails, you can proceed :+1:

:x: If not, please [reauthenticate to GitHub](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/macos.md#github-cli) before running this command :point_up: again.

### git installer

Run the `git` installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles && zsh git_setup.sh
```

:point_up: This will **prompt** you for your name (`FirstName LastName`) and your email.

:warning: You **need** to put one of the email listed above thanks to the previous `gh api ...` command. If you don't do that, Kitt won't be able to track your progress.

Please now **reset** your terminal by running:

```bash
exec zsh
```


## rbenv

Let's install [`rbenv`](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), a software to install and manage `ruby` environments.

First, we need to clean up any previous Ruby installation you might have:

```bash
rvm implode && sudo rm -rf ~/.rvm
# If you got "zsh: command not found: rvm", carry on. It means `rvm` is not
# on your computer, that's what we want!

sudo rm -rf $HOME/.rbenv /usr/local/rbenv /opt/rbenv /usr/local/opt/rbenv
```

:warning: This command may prompt for your password.

:warning: When you type your password, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your password as a whole but also its length. Just type your password and when you're done, press `Enter`.

In the terminal, run:

```bash
brew uninstall --force rbenv ruby-build
exec zsh
```

Then run:

```bash
brew install rbenv
```


## Ruby

### Installation

Now, you are ready to install the latest [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) version and set it as the default version.

Run this command, it will **take a while (5-10 minutes)**

```bash
rbenv install 3.1.2
```

Once the ruby installation is done, run this command to tell the system
to use the 3.1.2 version by default.

```bash
rbenv global 3.1.2
```

**Reset** your terminal and check your Ruby version:

```bash
exec zsh
```

Then run:

```bash
ruby -v
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see something starting with `ruby 3.1.2p` then you can proceed +1:

:x: If not, **ask a teacher**

### Installing some gems

<details>
  <summary>If you are in <bold>China</bold> 🇨🇳 click here</summary>

  :warning: If you are in China, you should update the way we'll install gem with the following commands.

```bash
# China only!
gem sources --remove https://rubygems.org/
gem sources -a https://gems.ruby-china.com/
gem sources -l
# *** CURRENT SOURCES ***
# https://gems.ruby-china.com/
# Ruby-china.com must be in the list now
```
</details>

**Everyone, in China or not**, continue here to install gems.

In the ruby world, we call external libraries `gems`: they are pieces of ruby code that you can download and execute on your computer. Let's install some!

In your terminal, copy-paste the following command:

```bash
gem install colored faker http pry-byebug rake rails rest-client rspec rubocop-performance sqlite3
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you get `xx gems installed`, then all good :+1:

:x: If you encounter the following error:

```bash
ERROR: While executing gem ... (TypeError)
incompatible marshal file format (can't be read)
format version 4.8 required; 60.33 given
```

Run the following command:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.gemrc
```

Rerun the command to install the gems.

:warning: **NEVER** install a gem with `sudo gem install`! Even if you stumble upon a Stackoverflow answer (or the terminal) telling you to do so.


## Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime to execute JavaScript code in the terminal. Let's install it with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), a version manager for Node.js.

In a terminal, execute the following commands:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | zsh
exec zsh
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
nvm -v
```

You should see a version. If not, ask a teacher.

Now let's install node:

```bash
nvm install 16.15.1
```

When the installation is finished, run:

```bash
node -v
```

If you see `v16.15.1`, the installation succeeded :heavy_check_mark: You can then run:

```bash
nvm cache clear
```

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**


## yarn

[`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager to install JavaScript libraries. Let's install it:

In a terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
exec zsh
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
yarn -v
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see a version, you're good :+1:

:x: If not, **ask for a teacher**


## SQLite

In a few weeks, we'll talk about databases and SQL. [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) is a database engine used to execute SQL queries on single-file databases. Let's install it:

In a terminal, execute the following commands:

```bash
brew install sqlite
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 -version
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see a version, you're good :+1:

:x: If not, **ask for a teacher**


## PostgreSQL

Sometimes, SQLite is not enough and we will need a more advanced tool called [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), an open-source robust and production-ready database system.

Let's install it now.

Run the following commands:

```bash
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```

Once you've done that, let's check that it worked:

```bash
psql -d postgres
```

If you enter a new prompt like this one, you're good!

```bash
psql (13.3)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

To quit it, type `\q` then `Enter`.


## Check-up

Let's check if you successfully installed everything.

In you terminal, run the following command:

```bash
exec zsh
```

Then run:

```bash
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/setup/master/check.rb > _.rb && ruby _.rb && rm _.rb || rm _.rb
```

:check_mark: If you get a green `Awesome! Your computer is now ready!`, then you're good :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.


## Kitt

:warning: If you have received an email from Le Wagon inviting you to sign up on Kitt (our learning platform), you can safely skip this step. Instead, please follow the instructions in the email you received if you haven't done so already.

If you are unsure about what to do, you can follow [this link](https://kitt.lewagon.com/). If you are already logged in, you can safely skip this section. If you are not logged in, click on `Enter Kitt as a Student`. If you manage to login, you can safely skip this step. Otherwise ask a teacher whether you should have received an email or follow the instructions below.

Register as a Wagon alumni by going to [kitt.lewagon.com/onboarding](http://kitt.lewagon.com/onboarding). Select your batch, sign in with GitHub and enter all your information.

Your teacher will then validate that you are indeed part of the batch. You can ask him to do it as soon as you completed the registration form.

Once the teacher has approved your profile, go to your email inbox. You should have 2 emails:

- One from Slack, inviting you to the Le Wagon Alumni slack community (where you'll chat with your buddies and all the previous alumni). Click on **Join** and fill the information.
- One from GitHub, inviting you to `lewagon` team. **Accept it** otherwise you won't be able to access the lecture slides.


## Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a communcation platform pretty popular in the tech industry.

### Installation

[Download the Slack app](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12) and install it.

:warning: If you are already using Slack in your browser, please download and install **the desktop app** which is fully featured.


### Settings

Launch the app and sign in to `lewagon-alumni` organization.

Make sure you **upload a profile picture** :point_down:

![How to upload a profile picture on Slack](images/slack_profile_picture.gif)

The idea is that you'll have Slack open all day, so that you can share useful links / ask for help / decide where to go to lunch / etc.

To ensure that everything is working fine for video calls, let's test your camera and microphone:
- Open the Slack app
- In any channel message bar type `/call --test` and press `Enter`
- Click on the "Start test" green button

![Check microphone and webcam with Slack](images/slack_call_test.png)

:heavy_check_mark: When the test is finished, you should see green "Succeed" messages at least for your microphone and camera. :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.

You can also install Slack app on your phone and sign in `lewagon-alumni`!


## macOS settings

### Security

It is mandatory that you protect your session behind a password.If it is not already the case, go to ` > System Preferences > Users & Groups` and change your account password. You should also go to ` > System Preferences > Security > General`. You should require a password `5 seconds` after sleep or screen saver begins.

You can also go to ` > System Preferences > Mission Control` and click on the `Hot Corners` button at the bottom left. Choose for the bottom right corner to start the screen saver. That way, when you leave your desk, you can quickly lock you screen by putting your mouse in the bottom right corner. 5 seconds after, your Macbook will be locked and will ask for a password to get back on the session.

### Keyboard

As you become a programmer, you'll understand that leaving the keyboard takes a lot of time, so you'll want to minimize using the trackpad or the mouse. Here are a few tricks on macOS to help you do that.

#### Keyboard speed

Go to ` > System Preferences > Keyboard`. Set `Key Repeat` to the fastest position (to the right) and `Delay Until Repeat` to the shortest position (to the right).

#### Full Keyboard Access

Go to ` > System Preferences > Keyboard`. Click on the third tab `Shortcuts`. At the bottom of the pane, click the radio button `All controls`. This way when you get a dialog with several options, you'll be able to type `Enter` to confirm, or `SPACE` to choose the cancel option. If you have more than two options, you can use tab to circle between them.

#### macOS For hackers

[Read this script](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) and cherry-pick some stuff you think will suit you. For instance, you can type in the terminal this one:

```bash
# Expanding the save panel by default
defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSNavPanelExpandedStateForSaveMode -bool true
defaults write NSGlobalDomain PMPrintingExpandedStateForPrint -bool true
defaults write NSGlobalDomain PMPrintingExpandedStateForPrint2 -bool true

# Save screenshots to the Desktop (or elsewhere)
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location "${HOME}/Desktop"

# etc..
```

### Pin apps to your dock

You are going to use most of the apps you've installed today really often. Let's pin them to your dock so that they are just one click away!

To pin an app to your dock, launch the app, right-click on the icon in the taskbar to bring up the context menu and choose "Options" then "Keep in Dock".

![How to pin an app to the taskbar in macOS](images/macos_dock.png)

You must pin:
- Your terminal
- Your file explorer
- VS Code
- Your Internet browser
- Slack
- Zoom


## Setup completed!

Your computer is now all set for [Le Wagon Web Development course](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course/full-time) :muscle: :clap:

Enjoy the bootcamp, you will nail it :rocket:
