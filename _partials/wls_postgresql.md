## Postgresql

In a few weeks, we'll talk about SQL and Databases and you'll need something called Postgresql, an open-source robust and production-ready database.

Let's install it now.


```bash
sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev build-essential
```
```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start
```
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql --command "CREATE ROLE `whoami` LOGIN createdb;"
```

You can configure PostgreSQL to autostart, so you don't have to execute `sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start` each time you open a new terminal:

```bash
sudo echo "`whoami` ALL=NOPASSWD:/etc/init.d/postgresql start" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/postgresql
```
```bash
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/postgresql
```
```bash
echo "sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start" >> ~/.zshrc
```
