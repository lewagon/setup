## Zoom

To be able to interact when we are not in the same physical room, we will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), a video conferencing tool.

:warning: If you already have Zoom installed, please make sure that the version is at least **5.6**.

Go to [zoom.us/download](https://zoom.us/download).

Under **Zoom Client** click the **Download** button.

Open the file you have just downloaded to install the app.

Open the Zoom app.

If you have a Mac with Apple silicon, [you are asked to install Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861). Click Install, then enter your user name and password to allow installation to proceed.

![Install Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/macos/Big-Sur/macos-big-sur-software-update-rosetta-alert.jpg)

If you already have a Zoom account, sign in using your credentials.

If not, click on the **Sign Up Free** link:

You will be redirected to Zoom's website to complete a form.

When it's done, go back to the Zoom app and sign in using your credentials.

You should then see a screen like this:

You can now close the Zoom app.
