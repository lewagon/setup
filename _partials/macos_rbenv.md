## rbenv

Let's install [`rbenv`](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), a software to install and manage `ruby` environments.

First, we need to clean up any previous Ruby installation you might have:

```bash
rvm implode && sudo rm -rf ~/.rvm
# If you got "zsh: command not found: rvm", carry on. It means `rvm` is not
# on your computer, that's what we want!

sudo rm -rf $HOME/.rbenv /usr/local/rbenv /opt/rbenv /usr/local/opt/rbenv
```

:warning: This command may prompt for your password.

:warning: When you type your password, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your password as a whole but also its length. Just type your password and when you're done, press `ENTER`.

In the terminal, run:

```bash
brew uninstall --force rbenv ruby-build
exec zsh
```

Then run:

```bash
brew install rbenv
```
