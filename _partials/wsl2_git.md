## Git

To install `git`:


>\- Open an Ubuntu terminal.
>\- Copy and paste the following lines:


```bash
sudo apt update
```
```bash
sudo apt install -y git apt-transport-https unzip gnome-terminal
````

Let's now install GitHub [official CLI](https://cli.github.com) (Command Line Interface) with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-key C99B11DEB97541F0
sudo apt-add-repository https://cli.github.com/packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gh
```

To check that `gh` has been successfully installed on your machine, you can run:

```bash
gh --version
```

If you don't get a prompt saying `gh version X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)` with at least version 1.4, please refer to [the documentation](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#official-sources) where they list some troubleshooting information. In doubt, ask a TA.
