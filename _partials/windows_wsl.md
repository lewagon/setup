 ### Install WSL
  
WSL is the development environment we are using to run Ubuntu. You can learn more about WSL [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq).

We will install WSL through the PowerShell Terminal:

:warning: In the following instruction, please be aware of the `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter` key stroke to execute **Windows PowerShell** with administrator privileges instead of just clicking on `Ok`or pressing `Enter`.

- Press `Windows` + `R`
- Type  `powershell`
- Press **`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter`**

:warning: You may have to accept the UAC confirmation about the privilege elevation.

A blue terminal window will appear:

- Copy the following command (`CTRL` + `C`)
- Paste them into the PowerShell window (`CTRL` + `V` or by right-clicking in the window)
- Run them by pressing `Enter`
  
  ```powershell
  wsl --install
  ```
  
 Restart your computer to finish the WSL installation on Windows 11
