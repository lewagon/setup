## Windows Subsystem for Linux

### Install WSL 1

WSL is the development environment we are using to run Ubuntu. You can learn more about WSL [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq).

We will install WSL through the PowerShell Terminal:

:warning: In the following instruction, please be aware of the `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter` key stroke to execute **Windows PowerShell** with administrator privileges instead of just clicking on `Ok`or pressing `Enter`.

- Press `Windows` + `R`
- Type  `powershell`
- Press **`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter`**

:warning: You may have to accept the UAC confirmation about the privilege elevation.

A blue terminal window will appear:

- Copy the following commands one by one (`CTRL` + `C`)
- Paste them into the PowerShell window (`CTRL` + `V` or by right-clicking in the window)
- Run them by pressing `Enter`

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

:white_check_mark: If all three commands ran without any error, please restart your terminal and continue below :+1:

:x: If you encounter an error message (or if you see some text in red in the window), please **contact a teacher**

### Upgrade to WSL 2

Once your computer has restarted, we need to download the WSL2 installer.

- Go to the [download page](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel)
- Download "WSL2 Linux kernel update package"
- Open the file you've just downloaded
- Click `Next`
- Click `Finish`

:white_check_mark: If didn't encounter any error message, you're good to go :+1:

:x: If you encounter the error "This update only applies to machines with the Windows Subsystem for Linux", **right click** on the program and select `uninstall`; you shall be able to install it normally this time.

### Make WSL 2 the default Windows Subsystem for Linux

Now that WSL 2 is installed, let's make it the default version:
- Press `Windows` + `R`
- Type  `cmd`
- Press `Enter`

In the window which appears, type:

```bash
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

:white_check_mark: If you see "The operation completed successfully, you can close this terminal and continue below :+1:

:x: If the message you get is about Virtualization, please **contact a teacher**
