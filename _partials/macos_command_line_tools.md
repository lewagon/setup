## A note about quitting apps on a Mac

Clicking the little red cross in the top left corner of the application window on a Mac **does not really quit it**, it just closes an active window. To quit the application _for real_ either press `Cmd + Q` when the application is active, or navigate to `APP_NAME` -> `Quit` in the menu bar.

During this setup you will be asked to **quit and re-open** applications multiple times, please make sure you do it properly :pray:

## Command Line Tools

Open a new terminal, copy-paste the following command and hit `ENTER`:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

If you receive the following message, you can just skip this step and go to next step.

```bash
# command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates
```

Otherwise, it will open a window asking you if you want to install some software: click on "Install" and wait.

:heavy_check_mark: If you see the message "The software was installed" then all good :+1:

:x: If the command `xcode-select --install` fails try again: sometimes the Apple servers are overloaded.

:x: If you see the message "Xcode is not currently available from the Software Update server", you need to update the software update catalog:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog
```

Once this is done, you can try to install again.
