## Zoom

To be able to interact when we are not in the same physical room, we will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), a video conferencing tool.

:warning: If you already have Zoom installed, please make sure that the version is at least **5.6**.

- Go to [zoom.us/download](https://zoom.us/download)
- Under **Zoom Client** click the **Download** button
- Open the file you have just downloaded to install the app
- Open the Zoom app
- If you already have a Zoom account, sign in using your credentials
- If not, click on the **Sign Up Free** link:

![Sign Up Free to Zoom](images/zoom_sign_up_free.png)

You will be redirected to Zoom's website to complete a form.

When it's done, go back to the Zoom app and sign in using your credentials.

You should then see a screen like this:

![Zoom Home Screen](images/zoom_home_screen.png)

You can now close the Zoom app.
