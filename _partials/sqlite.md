## SQLite

In a few weeks, we'll talk about databases and SQL. [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) is a database engine used to execute CRUD commands on database files. Let's install it:

In a terminal, execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 -version
```

✅  If you see a version, you're good +1
❌  If not, ask for a teacher
