## Windows version

Before we start, we need to check that the version of Windows installed on your computer is compatible with this setup instructions.

### Windows 10 or Windows 11

To be able to set up your computer, you need to have **Windows 10 or Windows 11** installed.

To check your Windows version:
- Press `Windows` + `R`
- Type  `winver`
- Press `Enter`

:heavy_check_mark: If the first words of this window are **Windows 10 or Windows 11** you're good to go :+1:

:x: If not, you cannot proceed with this setup. You have to upgrade to Windows 10 first :point_down:

  <summary>Upgrade to Windows 10</summary>

  - Download Windows 10 from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10ISO)
  - Install it. It should take roughly an hour, but this depends on your computer.
  - When the installation is over, execute the commands above :point_up: to check that you now have **Windows 10**.

:information_source: [Windows 11 upgrade is rolling out now](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-11), which means it may or may not be available for your computer just yet.

:warning: **If you have Windows 10 installed, you don't need to upgrade to Windows 11 to proceed with this setup**.

### Latest updates

Once you're sure that you're using Windows 10 or 11, you need to install all the latest updates.

Open Windows Update:
- Press `Windows` + `R`
- Type  `ms-settings:windowsupdate`
- Press `Enter`

:heavy_check_mark: If you see a green check mark and the message "You're up to date", you're good to go :+1:

:warning: If you have a red exclamation mark and the message "Update available", please install them and repeat the process until it says that you are up to date :loop:

:x: If you have an error message about Windows not being able to apply updates, please **contact a teacher**.
