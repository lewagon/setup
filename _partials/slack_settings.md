The idea is that you'll have Slack open all day, so that you can share useful links / ask for help / decide where to go to lunch / etc.

To ensure that everything is working fine for video calls, let's test your camera and microphone:
- Open the Slack app
- Click your profile picture in the top right.
- Select `Preferences` from the menu.
- Click `Audio & video` in the left-side column.
- Below `Troubleshooting`, click `Run an audio, video and screensharing test`. The test will open in a new window.
- Check that your preferred speaker, microphone and camera devices appear in the drop-down menus, then click `Start test`.

:heavy_check_mark: When the test is finished, you should see green "Succeed" messages at least for your microphone and camera. :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.

You can also install Slack app on your phone and sign in `lewagon-alumni`!
