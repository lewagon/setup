## Linking your default browser to Ubuntu

To be sure that you can interact with your browser installed on Windows from your Ubuntu terminal, we need to set it as your default browser there.

:warning: You need to execute at least one of the following commands below:

Restart your terminal.

Then please make sure that the following command returns "Browser defined üëå":

```bash
[ -z "$BROWSER" ] && echo "ERROR: please define a BROWSER environment variable ‚ö†Ô∏è" || echo "Browser defined üëå"
```

If it does not,

:heavy_check_mark: If you got this message, you can continue :+1:

:x: If not, choose a browser in the list above and execute the corresponding command. Then don't forget to reset your terminal:

```bash
exec zsh
```

Do not hesitate to **contact a teacher**.
