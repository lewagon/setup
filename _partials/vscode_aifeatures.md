### VS Code AI Features

VS Code includes many powerful **AI features**, which are a great tool once you already know how to code.

That said, relying on AI too early can hide important concepts and make debugging harder to understand. Once you’re comfortable with the fundamentals, you’ll know when and how to use AI effectively — without letting it do the thinking for you.

For the start of the bootcamp, we’ll disable these features. At the right point in the course, we’ll reenable them so you can put them to good use.

In **VS Code**:

1. Let's open the VS Code "Command **P**alette": type `Ctrl-Shift-P` (Windows / Linux) or `Cmd-Shift-P` (macOS).
1. This will open the Command Palette: a small text box at the top of your screen. Start typing `aifeatures` until you see "Chat: Learn How to Hide AI features". Click on it.

1. This will open the settings, and will show you the option "Disable and hide built-in AI features ...". Tick the checkbox in front of that option.

Later, if you want **to reenable** the AI features, you can follow the same instructions to untick the checkbox.
