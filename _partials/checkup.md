## Check-up

Let's check if you successfully installed everything.

Quit all opened Terminal, open a new one and run the following commands:

<!-- TODO(dmilon): update branch before merging with master -->
```bash
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/setup/vscode/check.rb > _.rb && ruby _.rb && rm _.rb || rm _.rb
```

:check_mark: If you get a green `Awesome! Your computer is now ready!`, then you're good :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.
