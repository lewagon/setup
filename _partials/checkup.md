## Check-up

Let's check if you successfully installed everything.

Quit all opened Terminal, open a new one and run the following commands:

```bash
$ curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/setup/master/check.rb | ruby
```

It should tell you if your workstation is ready :) If not, ask a teacher.

Now we'll wait for others to complete the setup as well. You can
[play with the terminal](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) or help others.
