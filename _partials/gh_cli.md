## GitHub CLI

CLI is the acronym of [Command-line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

In this section, we will install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to perform useful actions with GitHub data directly from the Terminal.

It should already be installed on your laptop from the previous commands. First you need to **login**, copy the following line (**do not** edit it!) and paste it in your terminal, then press the `Enter` key:

```bash
gh auth login -s 'user:email' -w
```

You will get the following output:

```bash
- Logging into github.com

! First copy your one-time code: 0EF9-D015
- Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
```

Select and copy the code (`0EF9-D015` in the example), then type `Enter`. Your browser will open and ask you to authorize GitHub CLI to use your GitHub account. Accept and wait a bit. Come back to the terminal, type `Enter` again, and that should be it :tada:

To check that you are properly connected, type:

```bash
gh auth status
```

If you get `Logged in to github.com as <YOUR USERNAME> `, then all good. If not, **ask a teacher**.

Then run the following configuration line:

```bash
gh config set git_protocol ssh
```

Finally, create a [gist](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists) to make sure `gh` is working:

```bash
echo "Hello [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com) :wave:" | gh gist create -d "Starting my coding journey..." -f "SETUP_DAY.md" -p -w
```

This line should open your browser on the newly created gist page. See, we've just created a [**Markdown**](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) file!
