## GitHub CLI

CLI is the acronym of [Command-line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

In this section, we will install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to perform useful actions with GitHub data directly from the terminal.

It should already be installed on your laptop from the previous commands. First you need to **login**, copy the following line (**do not** edit it!) and paste it in your terminal, then press the `ENTER` key:

```bash
gh auth login -s 'user:email' -w
```

You will get the following output:

```bash
! First copy your one-time code: 0EF9-D015
- Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
```

Select and copy the code (`0EF9-D015` in the example), then press `ENTER`. Your browser will open and ask you to authorize GitHub CLI to use your GitHub account. Accept and wait a bit.

Come back to the terminal, press `ENTER` again, and that's it.

To check that you are properly connected, type:

```bash
gh auth status
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you get `Logged in to github.com as <YOUR USERNAME> `, then all good :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.

Then run the following configuration line:

```bash
gh config set git_protocol ssh
```
