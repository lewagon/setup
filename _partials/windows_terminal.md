## Windows Terminal

### Installation

:information_source: The following instructions depend on your version of Windows.

If you are running Windows 11, the Windows Terminal is already installed and you can proceed to the next section :point_down:

If you are running Windows 10, let's install Windows Terminal, a real modern terminal:

- Click on `Start`
- Type  `Microsoft Store`
- Click on `Microsoft Store` in the list
- Search for `Windows Terminal` in the search bar
- **Select Windows Terminal"**
- Click on `Install`

:warning: DO NOT install **Windows Terminal Preview**, just **Windows Terminal**!

<details>
  <summary>Uninstall wrong version of Windows Terminal</summary>

  To uninstall a wrong version of Windows Terminal, you just have to go to the Installed Program List of Windows 10:

  - Press `Windows` + `R`
  - Type  `ms-settings:appsfeatures`
  - Press `Enter`

  Find the software to uninstall and click on the uninstall button.
</details>

Once the installation is finished, the `Install` button becomes a `Launch` button: click on it.

### Ubuntu as the default terminal

Let's make Ubuntu the default terminal of your Windows Terminal application.

Press `Ctrl` + `,`

It should open the terminal settings:

- Change the default profile to "Ubuntu"
- Click on "Save"
- Click on "Open JSON file"

We have circle in red the part you will change:

First, let's ask Ubuntu to start directly inside your Ubuntu Home Directory instead of the Windows one:
- Locate the `"name": "Ubuntu",`
- Add the following line after it:

```bash
"commandline": "wsl.exe ~",
```

:warning: Do not forget the comma at the end of the line!

Then, let's disable warning for copy-pasting commands between Windows and Ubuntu:
- Locate the line `"defaultProfile": "{2c4de342-...}"`
- Add the following line after it:

```bash
"multiLinePasteWarning": false,
```

:warning: Do not forget the comma at the end of the line!

You can save these changes by pressing `Ctrl` + `S`

:heavy_check_mark: Your **Windows Terminal** is now setup :+1:

This terminal has tabs: you can choose to open a new terminal tab by clicking on the **+** next to the current one.

**From now on, every time we will refer to the terminal or the console it will be this one.** DO NOT use any other terminal anymore.
