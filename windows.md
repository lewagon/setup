# Setup instructions

You will find below the instructions to set up your computer for [Le Wagon Web Development course](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course/full-time).

Please **read them carefully and execute all commands in the following order**.

If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask a teacher for help :raising_hand:

You can also have a look at [our cheatsheets](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/tree/master/docs) for common issue fixes and tips :heavy_check_mark:

Let's start :rocket:


## Zoom

To be able to interact when we are not in the same physical room, we will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), a video conferencing tool.

:warning: If you already have Zoom installed, please make sure that the version is at least **5.6**.

Go to [zoom.us/download](https://zoom.us/download).

Under **Zoom Client** click the **Download** button.

Open the file you have just downloaded to install the app.

Open the Zoom app.

If you already have a Zoom account, sign in using your credentials.

If not, click on the **Sign Up Free** link:

![Sign Up Free to Zoom](images/zoom_sign_up_free.png)

You will be redirected to Zoom's website to complete a form.

When it's done, go back to the Zoom app and sign in using your credentials.

You should then see a screen like this:

![Zoom Home Screen](images/zoom_home_screen.png)

You can now close the Zoom app.


## GitHub account

Have you signed up to GitHub? If not, [do it right away](https://github.com/join).

:point_right: **[Upload a picture](https://github.com/settings/profile)** and put your name correctly on your GitHub account. This is important as we'll use an internal dashboard with your avatar. Please do this **now**, before you continue with this guide.

![GitHub picture](images/github_picture.png)

:point_right: **[Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-text-messages)**. GitHub will send you text messages with a code when you try to log in. This is important for security and also will soon be required in order to contribute code on GitHub.


## Windows version

Before we start, we need to check that the version of Windows installed on your computer is compatible with this setup instructions.

### Windows 10 or Windows 11

</details>

### Check the locale

The locale is a mechanism allowing to customize programs to your language and country.

Let's verify that the default locale is set to English, please type this in the Ubuntu terminal:

```bash
locale
```

If the output does not contain `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`, run the following command in a Ubuntu terminal to install the english locale:

```bash
sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
```

If after, you receive a warning (`bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.utf-8)`) in your terminal, please do the following:

<details>

You may see an orange circle rather than a penguin as the logo for Ubuntu.

We have circle in red the part you will change:

![Windows Terminal JSON settings file](images/windows_terminal_settings_json.png)

First, let's ask Ubuntu to start directly inside your Ubuntu Home Directory instead of the Windows one:
- Locate the entry with both `"name": "Ubuntu",` and `"hidden": false,`
- Add the following line after it:

```bash
"commandline": "wsl.exe ~",
```

:warning: Do not forget the comma at the end of the line!

Then, let's disable warning for copy-pasting commands between Windows and Ubuntu:
- Locate the line `"defaultProfile": "{2c4de342-...}"`

## Command line tools

### Zsh & Git

Instead of using the default `bash` [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)), we will use `zsh`.

We will also use [`git`](https://git-scm.com/), a command line software used for version control.

Let's install them, along with other useful tools:
- Open an **Ubuntu terminal**
- Copy and paste the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt install -y curl git imagemagick jq unzip vim zsh tree
```

These commands will ask for your password: type it in.

### GitHub CLI installation

Let's now install [GitHub official CLI](https://cli.github.com) (Command Line Interface). It's a software used to interact with your GitHub account via the command line.

In your terminal, copy-paste the following commands and type in your password if asked:

```bash
sudo apt remove -y gitsome # gh command can conflict with gitsome if already installed
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
```

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
```

```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt install -y gh
```

To check that `gh` has been successfully installed on your machine, you can run:

```bash
gh --version
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see `gh version X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)`, you're good to go :+1:

:x: Otherwise, please **contact a teacher**


## Oh-my-zsh

Let's install the `zsh` plugin [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

In a terminal execute the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

If asked "Do you want to change your default shell to zsh?", press `Y`

At the end your terminal should look like this:

![Ubuntu terminal with OhMyZsh](images/oh_my_zsh.png)

:heavy_check_mark: If it does, you can continue :+1:

## Linking your default browser to Ubuntu

To be sure that you can interact with your browser installed on Windows from your Ubuntu terminal, we need to set it as your default browser there.

:warning: You need to execute at least one of the following commands below:

<details>
  <summary>Google Chrome as your default browser</summary>

  Run the command:

  ```bash
    ls /mnt/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe

Restart your terminal.

Then please make sure that the following command returns "Browser defined 👌":

```bash
[ -z "$BROWSER" ] && echo "ERROR: please define a BROWSER environment variable ⚠️" || echo "Browser defined 👌"
```

If it does not,

:heavy_check_mark: If you got this message, you can continue :+1:

:x: If not, choose a browser in the list above and execute the corresponding command. Then don't forget to reset your terminal:

```bash
exec zsh
```

Do not hesitate to **contact a teacher**.



## GitHub CLI

CLI is the acronym of [Command-line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

In this section, we will use [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to interact with GitHub directly from the terminal.

It should already be installed on your computer from the previous commands.

First in order to **login**, copy-paste the following command in your terminal:

:warning: **DO NOT edit the `email`**

```bash
gh auth login -s 'user:email' -w
```

gh will ask you few questions:

`What is your preferred protocol for Git operations?` With the arrows, choose `SSH` and press `Enter`. SSH is a protocol to log in using SSH keys instead of the well known username/password pair.

`Generate a new SSH key to add to your GitHub account?` Press `Enter` to ask gh to generate the SSH keys for you.

If you already have SSH keys, you will see instead `Upload your SSH public key to your GitHub account?` With the arrows, select your public key file path and press `Enter`.

`Enter a passphrase for your new SSH key (Optional)`. Type something you want and that you'll remember. It's a password to protect your private key stored on your hard drive. Then press `Enter`.

`Title for your SSH key`. You can leave it at the proposed "GitHub CLI", press `Enter`.

You will then get the following output:

```bash
! First copy your one-time code: 0EF9-D015
- Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
```

Select and copy the code (`0EF9-D015` in the example), then press `Enter`.

Your browser will open and ask you to authorize GitHub CLI to use your GitHub account. Accept and wait a bit.

Come back to the terminal, press `Enter` again, and that's it.

To check that you are properly connected, type:

```bash
gh auth status
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you get `Logged in to github.com as <YOUR USERNAME> `, then all good :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.


## Dotfiles (Standard configuration)

Hackers love to refine and polish their shell and tools.

We'll start with a great default configuration provided by Le Wagon: [`lewagon/dotfiles`](https://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles).

As your configuration is personal, you need your **own** repository storing it. So you will **fork** Le Wagon repository.

Forking means that you will create a new repo in your own GitHub account `$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles`, identical to the original Le Wagon one that you will be able to modify at will.

Open your terminal and set a variable for your GitHub username:

```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=`gh api user | jq -r '.login'`
```

```bash
echo $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

:heavy_check_mark: You should see your GitHub username printed.

:x: If not, **stop here** and ask for help. There may be a problem with the previous step (`gh auth`).

:warning: Please note that this variable is only set for the time your terminal is open. If you close it before or during the next steps, you need to set it again with the two steps above!


Time to fork the repo and clone it on your computer:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME && cd $_
```

```bash
gh repo fork lewagon/dotfiles --clone
```

### Dotfiles installer

Run the `dotfiles` installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles
```

```bash
zsh install.sh
```

Check the emails registered with your GitHub Account. You'll need to pick one at the next step:

```bash
gh api user/emails | jq -r '.[].email'
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see the list of your registered emails, you can proceed :+1:

:x: If not, please [reauthenticate to GitHub](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/windows.md#github-cli) before running this command :point_up: again.

### git installer

Run the `git` installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles && zsh git_setup.sh
```

:point_up: This will **prompt** you for your name (`FirstName LastName`) and your email.

:warning: You **need** to put one of the emails listed above thanks to the previous `gh api ...` command. If you don't do that, Kitt won't be able to track your progress. 💡 Select the `@users.noreply.github.com` address if you don't want your email to appear in public repositories you may contribute to.


Please now **reset** your terminal by running:

```bash
exec zsh
```


## Disable SSH passphrase prompt

You don't want to be asked for your passphrase every time you communicate with a distant repository. So, you need to add the plugin `ssh-agent` to `oh my zsh`:

First, open the `.zshrc` file:

```bash
code ~/.zshrc
```

Then:
- Spot the line starting with `plugins=`
- Add `ssh-agent` at the end of the plugins list

:heavy_check_mark: Save the `.zshrc` file with `Ctrl` + `S` and close your text editor.


## rbenv

Let's install [`rbenv`](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), a software to install and manage `ruby` environments.

First, we need to clean up any previous Ruby installation you might have:

```bash
rvm implode && sudo rm -rf ~/.rvm
# If you got "zsh: command not found: rvm", carry on.
# It means `rvm` is not on your computer, that's what we want!
rm -rf ~/.rbenv
```

Then in the terminal, run:

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential tklib zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
```

```bash
exec zsh
```


## Ruby

### Installation

Now, you are ready to install the latest [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) version and set it as the default version.

Run this command, it will **take a while (5-10 minutes)**

```bash
rbenv install 3.3.5
```

Once the ruby installation is done, run this command to tell the system
to use the 3.3.5 version by default.

```bash
rbenv global 3.3.5
```

**Reset** your terminal and check your Ruby version:

```bash
exec zsh
```

Then run:

```bash
ruby -v
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see something starting with `ruby 3.3.5` then you can proceed :+1:

:x: If not, **ask a teacher**

### Installing some gems

<details>
  <summary>If you are in <bold>China</bold> 🇨🇳 click here</summary>

  :warning: If you are in China, you should update the way we'll install gem with the following commands.

```bash
# China only!
gem sources --remove https://rubygems.org/
gem sources -a https://gems.ruby-china.com/
gem sources -l
# *** CURRENT SOURCES ***
# https://gems.ruby-china.com/
# Ruby-china.com must be in the list now
```
</details>

**Everyone, in China or not**, continue here to install gems.

In the ruby world, we call external libraries `gems`: they are pieces of ruby code that you can download and execute on your computer. Let's install some!

First, we'll update `bundler`, which is what lets us install gems:

```bash
gem update bundler
```

In your terminal, copy-paste the following command:

```bash
gem install colored faker http pry-byebug rake rails:7.1.3.4 rest-client rspec rubocop-performance sqlite3:1.7.3 activerecord:7.1.3.2
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you get `xx gems installed`, then all good :+1:

:x: If you encounter the following error:

```bash
ERROR: While executing gem ... (TypeError)
incompatible marshal file format (can't be read)
format version 4.8 required; 60.33 given
```

Run the following command:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.gemrc
```

Rerun the command to install the gems.

:warning: **NEVER** install a gem with `sudo gem install`! Even if you stumble upon a Stackoverflow answer (or the terminal) telling you to do so.


## Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime to execute JavaScript code in the terminal. Let's install it with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), a version manager for Node.js.

In a terminal, execute the following commands:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | zsh
```

```bash
exec zsh
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
nvm -v
```

You should see a version. If not, ask a teacher.

Now let's install node:

```bash
nvm install 20.17.0
```

When the installation is finished, run:

```bash
node -v
```

If you see `v20.17.0`, the installation succeeded :heavy_check_mark: You can then run:

```bash
nvm cache clear
```

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**


## yarn

[`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager to install JavaScript libraries. Let's install it:

In a terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
corepack enable
yarn set version stable
```

⚠️ If you see any error messages, try running `npm install -g corepack` and then run the commands above again.

```bash
exec zsh
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
yarn -v
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see a version, you're good :+1:

:x: If not, **ask for a teacher**


## SQLite

In a few weeks, we'll talk about databases and SQL. [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) is a database engine used to execute SQL queries on single-file databases. Let's install it:

In a terminal, execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev pkg-config
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 -version
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see a version, you're good :+1:

:x: If not, **ask for a teacher**


## PostgreSQL

Sometimes, SQLite is not enough and we will need a more advanced tool called [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), an open-source robust and production-ready database system.

Let's install it now.

Run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev build-essential
```

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start
```

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql --command "CREATE ROLE \"`whoami`\" LOGIN createdb superuser;"
```

_📝 If you get an error saying `could not change directory to "/home/your_name": Permission denied` that is totally fine, and there's no need to worry 💆 If, on the first run, it says `CREATE ROLE` in the end all worked fine._

You can configure PostgreSQL to autostart, so you don't have to execute `sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start` each time you open a new terminal:

```bash
sudo echo "`whoami` ALL=NOPASSWD:/etc/init.d/postgresql start" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/postgresql
```

```bash
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/postgresql
```

```bash
echo "sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start" >> ~/.zshrc
```

Open a new terminal.

:heavy_check_mark: If you see a `* Starting postgresql (via systemctl): postgresql.service` OR `* Starting PostgreSQL 14 database server` message, you're good to go :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.


## Check-up

Let's check if you successfully installed everything.

In you terminal, run the following command:

```bash
exec zsh
```

Then run:

```bash
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/setup/master/check.rb > _.rb && ruby _.rb && rm _.rb || rm _.rb
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you get a green `Awesome! Your computer is now ready!`, then you're good :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.


## Kitt

:warning: If you have received an email from Le Wagon inviting you to sign up on Kitt (our learning platform), you can safely skip this step. Instead, please follow the instructions in the email you received if you haven't done so already.

If you are unsure about what to do, you can follow [this link](https://kitt.lewagon.com/). If you are already logged in, you can safely skip this section. If you are not logged in, click on `Enter Kitt as a Student`. If you manage to login, you can safely skip this step. Otherwise ask a teacher whether you should have received an email or follow the instructions below.

Register as a Wagon alumni by going to [kitt.lewagon.com/onboarding](http://kitt.lewagon.com/onboarding). Select your batch, sign in with GitHub and enter all your information.

Your teacher will then validate that you are indeed part of the batch. You can ask them to do it as soon as you completed the registration form.

Once the teacher has approved your profile, go to your email inbox. You should have 2 emails:

- One from Slack, inviting you to the Le Wagon Alumni slack community (where you'll chat with your buddies and all the previous alumni). Click on **Join** and fill the information.
- One from GitHub, inviting you to `lewagon` team. **Accept it** otherwise you won't be able to access the lecture slides.


## Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a communication platform pretty popular in the tech industry.

### Installation

[Download the Slack app](https://slack.com/downloads/windows) and install it.

:warning: If you are already using Slack in your browser, please download and install **the desktop app** which is fully featured.


### Settings

Launch the app and sign in to `lewagon-alumni` organization.

Make sure you **upload a profile picture** :point_down:

![How to upload a profile picture on Slack](images/slack_profile_picture.gif)

The idea is that you'll have Slack open all day, so that you can share useful links / ask for help / decide where to go to lunch / etc.

To ensure that everything is working fine for video calls, let's test your camera and microphone:
- Open the Slack app
- Click your profile picture in the top right.
- Select `Preferences` from the menu.
- Click `Audio & video` in the left-side column.
- Below `Troubleshooting`, click `Run an audio, video and screensharing test`. The test will open in a new window.
- Check that your preferred speaker, microphone and camera devices appear in the drop-down menus, then click `Start test`.

![Check microphone and webcam with Slack](images/slack_call_test.png)

:heavy_check_mark: When the test is finished, you should see green "Succeed" messages at least for your microphone and camera. :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.

You can also install Slack app on your phone and sign in `lewagon-alumni`!


## Windows settings

### Exchange files between Windows and Ubuntu

We need an easy way to transfer files from Windows to Ubuntu and vice versa.

In order to do that, let's create shortcuts to Ubuntu directories in the Windows **File Explorer**:
- Open the Windows File Explorer (or use the shortcut `WIN` + `E`)
- In the Address Bar, enter `\\wsl$\` (or `\\wsl$\Ubuntu` if it does not work)
- You now have acces to the Ubuntu file system
- Dive into the Ubuntu file system in order to look for directories of interest
- Drag the desired folders into the Address Bar in order to create shortcuts

![How to add a shortcut to Ubuntu file system on Windows](images/windows_ubuntu_file_system_shortcut.gif)

### Open the Windows File Explorer from the Ubuntu terminal

Another option to move files around is to open the Windows **File Explorer** from the Ubuntu terminal:
- Open an Ubuntu terminal
- Go to the directory you wish to explore
- Run the `explorer.exe .` command (alternatively, use `wslview .`)
- If you get an input output error message, run `wsl --shutdown` in a Windows PowerShell and reopen an Ubuntu terminal

![How to launch Windows Explorer from Ubuntu terminal](images/windows_explorer_from_terminal.png)

### Find your way in the Ubuntu File System

You might want to figure out the exact location of a Windows directory in the Ubuntu file system, or the other way around.

In order to convert a Windows path to and from an Ubuntu path:
- Open an Ubuntu terminal
- Use the `wslpath "C:\Program Files"` command in order to translate a Windows path into an Ubuntu path
- Use the `wslpath -w "/home"` command in order to translate an Ubuntu path into a Windows path
- In particular, the `wslpath -w $(pwd)` command returns the Windows path of the current Ubuntu directory

![How to access a Windows path from Ubuntu terminal](images/windows_path_from_terminal.png)

### Pin apps to your taskbar

You are going to use most of the apps you've installed today really often. Let's pin them to your taskbar so that they are just one click away!

To pin an app to your taskbar, launch the app, right-click on the icon in the taskbar to bring up the context menu and choose "Pin to taskbar".

![How to pin an app to the taskbar in Windows](images/windows_taskbar.png)

You must pin:
- Your terminal
- Your file explorer
- VS Code
- Your Internet browser
- Slack
- Zoom
